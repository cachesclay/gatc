This folder contains custom javascript files created by Cardinal Path for use
with Google Analytics (the service, not the drupal module). These files are
shared by tfa.org and the corps member application.

The files in gatc/ are used by tfa.org.

The files in gatc/app are used by the corps member application.

While the files are the same, we use these 2 distinct locations and copies of
the filesbecause tfa.org and the application have different release cycles. For
example, It's possible that the code specific to tfa.org may updated and the 2
locations' files will be out of synch, because we don't want to force the
application staff to QA their code every time we need a change to the tfa.org
code.
